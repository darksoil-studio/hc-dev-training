We recognize that the tech space is inequitable, so we have some bursaries available for applicants from systemically underrepresented groups. If this is you, please reach out to us at [hello@darksoil.studio](mailto:hello@darksoil.studio).

## Prerequisite: Basic Rust

While much of a Holochain app is coded in Javascript using your preferred front end frameworks, Rust is required for the core Holochain functionality and integrity, so we require some Rust experience as a prerequisite for this training.

If you’re an experienced Rust developer, then you’re ready to apply. 

If you aren’t an experienced Rust dev, then you’ll need to go through the following chapters from the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and exercises from the [Rustling Course](https://rustlings.cool/).
