## Outcome

Participants will walk away from the course with the ability to make simple Holochain apps.

## Course Overview

This training will run over the course of two weeks beginning on Monday the 3rd of February. 
Each day has around 2 hours of theory on zoom and then there are exercises to complete before the next session (expect around 2h for this depending on person and skill). 

The live sessions will be held at: 8 am PST / 11 am EST / 6pm CEST.

After we have gone through all the theory, you get to practice it through implementing a small app (we provide a few different designs to choose from) in the hackathon days.

During the two weeks after the course we will give ongoing asynchronous support for students that are building things and at the end of these two weeks we also offer a live session where we answer any questions or considerations that might have come up in building.

We recognize that the tech space is inequitable, so we have some bursaries available for applicants from systemically underrepresented groups. If this is you, please reach out to us at [hello@darksoil.studio](mailto:hello@darksoil.studio).

## Prerequisite: Basic Rust

While much of a Holochain app is coded in Javascript using your preferred front end frameworks, Rust is required for the core Holochain functionality and integrity, so we require some Rust experience as a prerequisite for this training.
