We recognize that the tech space is inequitable, so we have some bursaries available for applicants from systemically underrepresented groups. If this is you, please reach out to us at [hello@darksoil.studio](mailto:hello@darksoil.studio).

## Prerequisite: Basic Rust

While much of a Holochain app is coded in Javascript using your preferred front end frameworks, Rust is required for the core Holochain functionality and integrity, so we require some Rust experience as a prerequisite for this training.
